      We demonstrate texture filtering (also referred to as structure-preserving filtering) based on Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, which, unlike previous work, does not rely on any explicit measures to distinguish texture from structure, but can effectively deal with previously challenging large-scale and high-contrast textures. Top: input images with diverse types of textures. Bottom: texture filtered results produced by our method.

    We present a simple but effective technique to smooth out textures while
    preserving the prominent image structures. Our method is built upon a
    key observationâ€”the coarsest level in a Gaussian pyramid often naturally
    eliminates textures and summarizes the main image structures. This inspires
    our central idea for texture filtering, which is to progressively upsample
    the very low-resolution coarsest Gaussian pyramid level to a full-resolution
    texture smoothing result with well-preserved structures, under the guidance
    of each fine-scale Gaussian pyramid level and its associated Laplacian pyramid level. We show that our approach is effective to separate structure from
    texture of different scales, local contrasts, and forms, without degrading
    structures or introducing visual artifacts. We also demonstrate the applicability of our method on various applications including detail enhancement,
    image abstraction, HDR tone mapping, inverse halftoning, and LDR image enhancement.
